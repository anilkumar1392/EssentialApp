##   Organizing Modular Codebases with Horizontal and Vertical Slicing

## Learning Outcomes
Horizontal modular slicing by layers
Vertical modular slicing by features
Organizing the codebase into independent frameworks and projects


## 1. Monolith - Single project with a single application target
The most common way to organize projects is to keep all components in a single project with a single application target. For example, an iOS application target where all components live:

This may work well for small projects and prototypes but can quickly become a bottleneck as the team grows, and more features are added to the app.

The more code you add to a single target, the more conflicts will arise. And the longer it will take to build, run, and test the project.

Moreover, thereâ€™s no physical separation of modules. So, it requires discipline to keep your code modular.
